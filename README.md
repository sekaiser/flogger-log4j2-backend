# flogger-log4j2-backend
The purpose of this project is to investigate the possibility of contributing the google/flogger's log4j2 backend.

Please understand that this project is unstable at the moment and behavior may change.

NOTE: At the moment, this version does not merge log4j2 thread context and with flogger's context data anymore.

Please folllow the conversation in https://github.com/google/flogger/issues/145. Every feedback is highly appreciated.
